        <h2>What Was Booping?</h2>
        <p>On April 1st, 2024, Tumblr unleashed the <strong>Boop-o-meter</strong> upon its unsuspecting userbase. If you opted in, a little "Boop" button appeared next to your username. Click it, and a cat paw would flash across your screen as you delivered a boop to a fellow Tumblr user. That's it. That's the feature.</p>
        <p>And somehow, in the span of 24 hours, Tumblr users managed to send <strong>142,566,897 boops</strong>.</p>
        <p>One hundred forty-two million. For pressing a button that made a cat paw appear.</p>

        <h2>The Mechanics of Chaos</h2>
        <p>The boop system had layers, because of course it did:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Boop</strong>: Just click the button. A paw appears. A notification is sent. Simple.</li>
            <li><strong>Super Boop</strong>: Hover over the button until it spins once, then release. Users described the process as "outlining directions to summon a demonic entity."</li>
            <li><strong>Evil Boop</strong>: Hold the button until it spins two or three times. Desktop only, naturally, because mobile users cannot be trusted with this power.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You could boop yourself (Tumblr called this "boop laundering"). You could boop the cat on the boop-o-meter itself. If you booped enough, the cat would high-five you back. There were badges to earn at 1, 100, and 1000 boops. The counter said "MAX" at 1000, but this was a lie - you could keep booping forever into the void.</p>
        <p>The most booped Tumblr received <strong>874,212 boops</strong>. The most prolific booper bestowed <strong>127,073 boops</strong> upon those they found worthy. Over 500,000 Tumblrs engaged in mutual booping.</p>

        <h2>The Vibe</h2>
        <p>This was Tumblr at its most Tumblr. The website famous for the Mishapocalypse, for selling users their own posts as "artifacts," for the lizard election of 2016 - this was their legacy. And booping fit right in.</p>
        <p>Users clicked for hours. One person admitted: "I just wanted the emoticon and I think I was clicking for about 5 hours in total." They used both laptop and phone simultaneously. For a cat paw button. This is the dedication that built pyramids.</p>
        <p>The feature spawned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fanart (of course)</li>
            <li>Discord emojis featuring the paw</li>
            <li>Star Wars memes styled like 2010s Tumblr posts</li>
            <li>Good Omens gifsets with boop captions</li>
            <li>"Boop survivor" commemorative art</li>
            <li>Guides explaining the arcane booping rituals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the clock struck midnight and the boops ended, there was genuine mourning. "It has been fun Booping with you lovely mutuals (and then some)!" users posted, like soldiers at the end of a strange but beautiful war.</p>

        <h2>The Halloween Encore</h2>
        <p>Tumblr brought booping back for Halloween 2024 as the <strong>BOOp-o-meter</strong> (they did the pun, yes). This time with spooky paws:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ghost paw (white, spectral)</li>
            <li>Skeleton paw (bony, rattling presumably)</li>
            <li>Mummy paw (wrapped, ancient)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The meter changed color as you booped more - orange at 101 boops, white at 301. There was a poll to determine the superior Halloween paw. The skeleton paw's supporters remain convinced they were robbed.</p>

        <h2>Why It Mattered</h2>
        <p>In an internet of engagement metrics, algorithmic feeds, and platform decay, Tumblr gave people a button that did almost nothing - and they pressed it 142 million times.</p>
        <p>The boop button wasn't trying to increase time-on-site for advertisers. It wasn't a growth hack. It was a cat paw that said "I see you" to another person on the internet. And sometimes that's everything.</p>
        <p class="highlight">"Everyone gets one last boop," a post read as the clock ran out. "Choose yours wisely."</p>

        </table>
        <p>The boop was special because it was mobile-friendly (a first!) and purely social. Not an inside joke about platform drama. Not a reference you had to understand. Just: boop your friends. Boop strangers. Boop yourself, you weirdo.</p>
